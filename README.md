All credit goes to him for being the starting point of the project. My goal with this is the modify it to fit my needs in the community Discord server I own. Currently the code doesn't work and I'm attempting to figure out why. 
My biggest issue with it currently is trying to get the code to work, and to add a feature which restricts certain commands to being used only with people with the (@moderator) role in the server.
